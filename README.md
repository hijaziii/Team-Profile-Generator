# Team-Profile-Generator 

I have Built a software engineering team generator command line application. This application will prompot the user for information about the team manager and the team members. Users can input as many team members they want and when users complete building the team, the application will creat HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

Note: This application have passed all unit tests.



# I have Included:

* The URL of the GitHub repository
